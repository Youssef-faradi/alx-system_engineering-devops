**Postmortem: Nginx Service Outage**

---

### Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Outage from 2024-06-20 14:00 UTC to 2024-06-20 16:30 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes).

**Impact:**  
During the outage, our primary web service was either down or extremely slow for approximately 75% of users. Users experienced timeouts, 502 Bad Gateway errors, and significant delays in accessing the website.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was an improperly configured Nginx server update that caused a spike in server load, leading to resource exhaustion and failure to serve incoming requests.

### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC** - Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating high error rates and slow response times.
- **14:05 UTC** - On-call engineer began investigation, confirming the issue through manual checks and logs.
- **14:15 UTC** - Initial hypothesis: potential DDoS attack due to high traffic patterns.
- **14:30 UTC** - Traffic analyzed; no abnormal external request patterns detected.
- **14:45 UTC** - Escalation to senior network engineering team.
- **15:00 UTC** - Identified recent Nginx server update as a potential cause.
- **15:15 UTC** - Rolled back to previous Nginx configuration; partial service restoration observed.
- **15:30 UTC** - Further analysis revealed a misconfiguration in the update related to worker processes and connection limits.
- **16:00 UTC** - Configuration corrected and validated in a staging environment.
- **16:15 UTC** - Applied corrected configuration to production.
- **16:30 UTC** - Full service restoration confirmed, monitoring normal.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by a recent update to the Nginx server configuration that included changes to the number of worker processes and the maximum number of connections per worker. These settings were incorrectly tuned, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption. The server reached its resource limits quickly, causing it to fail to handle incoming requests, resulting in timeouts and 502 errors.

**Resolution:**  
The resolution involved identifying the misconfiguration and reverting to the previous stable configuration. After confirming partial restoration of service, the team carefully adjusted the worker process and connection settings to appropriate levels. These changes were tested in a staging environment to ensure stability before being applied to the production servers.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Configuration Review Process:** Implement a stricter review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and automated configuration validation.
2. **Staging Environment Testing:** Ensure all configuration changes are thoroughly tested in a staging environment before being deployed to production.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add specific alerts for configuration-induced performance issues, such as CPU and memory usage spikes.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Apply updates to the Nginx server and ensure all configurations are documented.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory:** Enhance monitoring to include detailed tracking of CPU and memory usage, specifically for Nginx processes.
3. **Implement Automated Configuration Validation:** Develop and deploy tools to automatically validate configuration changes against best practices and resource limits.
4. **Documentation:** Update the internal documentation to reflect the changes in the configuration management process and the lessons learned from this incident.
5. **Training:** Conduct training sessions for engineers on best practices for configuring and tuning Nginx servers.
